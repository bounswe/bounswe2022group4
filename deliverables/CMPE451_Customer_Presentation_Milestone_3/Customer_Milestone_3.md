### Annotations
#### Status


For the frontend implementation of the annotation feature, we used the Recogito library for text annotation and the react-annotation library for image annotation. These libraries allowed us to provide an easy-to-use interface for users to highlight and annotate specific text or regions within a post. When text or an image was selected, it was highlighted to show that it had been annotated and a form was displayed so that users could enter their annotation and submit it to the backend.

For mobile implementation of annotation feature, we implemented custom android views with onDraw and onTouchHandling functionality for image annotation, and overrided the onSelectMenuActionCallbacks of the android TextView for text annotation. These views provided a similar interface to the one available on desktop computers, allowing users to annotate text or images by selecting a region and entering their annotation in a form. Additionally, we implemented a dialog that displayed all existing annotations when an image or text was clicked, providing a convenient way for users to review and interact with annotations made by others.

In the backend, we used the W3C Web Annotation data model to store and retrieve annotation data from the database. This data model provided a standardized and interoperable way to represent annotations and their relationships, ensuring compatibility with other annotation systems.

In conclusion, the implementation of the annotation feature for our application platform was a success.




  
  


#### Standards
The standard we follow for the image annotation is as follows:
```json
{
    "@context": "http://www.w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld",
    "id": "http://example.org/anno20",
    "type": "Annotation",
    "body": {
        "type" : "TextualBody",
        "value" : "<p>example!</p>",
        "format" : "text/html",
        "language" : "en"
    },
    "target": {
        "source": "http://example.org/post-slug",
        "selector": {
            "type": "FragmentSelector",
            "conformsTo": "http://www.w3.org/TR/media-frags/",
            "value": "xywh=50,50,640,480"
        }
    }
}  
```
Body's type is TextualBody and it contains the simple text, its language and its format. The target's source is the post url. It has a fragment selector. Target conforms to the following: "http://www.w3.org/TR/media-frags/." Selector has the value of the x, y, width and height coordinates.  

The standard we follow for the text annotation is as follows:
```json
{
    "@context": "http://www.w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld",
    "id": "http://example.org/anno20",
    "type": "Annotation",
    "body": {
        "type": "TextualBody",
        "value": "<p>example!</p>",
        "format": "text/html",
        "language": "en"

    },
    "target": {
        "source": "http://example.org/post-slug",
        "selector": {
            "type": "TextPositionSelector",
            "start": 0,
            "end": 0
        }
    }
}
```
Body's type is TextualBody and it contains the simple text, its language and its format. The target's source is the post url. It has a TextPositionselector. Selector has the start and end positions for the text annotations.

### *Main contributions*

During the development of the medical experience sharing platform, my main contributions were focused on implementing various features and functionalities related to the annotation feature. This included the implementation of the Single Post Page and URL, which allowed users to view a specific post in detail and share it via a unique URL. I also implemented the Report Post Button, which allowed users to report inappropriate or offensive posts to the platform's administrators. This was accompanied by the implementation of the Report Post Component, which displayed the report form to the user. Additionally, I implemented the Text Annotation feature, which allowed users to highlight and annotate specific text within a post. These efforts were supported by the implementation of the Profile Page Backend Connection and the Edit Profile Page Backend Connection, which enabled the synchronization of user data with the backend database. To enhance the user experience, I implemented the Edit Profile Page UI Update and the Update Search Bar UI and Location, which improved the visual design and functionality of these features. To further expand the annotation feature, I implemented the Single Profile Page with Dynamic URL, which allowed users to view the profile of a specific user and their associated posts and annotations. To ensure the proper structure and organization of annotations within posts, I implemented the Annotations Structure in Posts. Finally, I implemented the Image Annotation Backend Connection and the Text Annotation Backend Connection, which enabled the proper storage and retrieval of annotation data from the backend database.

In addition to these specific tasks, I also contributed to the development of the platform by preparing realistic posts and comments for Milestone 3, and by writing the Annotation section for the Milestone 3 report. I also provided support to other members of the frontend team, reviewed pull requests and issues, and made research on w3c annotation standards and react libraries to ensure the proper implementation of the annotation feature. I also worked to solve any bugs that arose in the frontend of the platform. Finally, I attended both general and frontend team meetings to stay updated on the progress of the project and collaborate with other team members.

### *Main contributions*
I implemented the search service as my main job. Later, in my remaining time, I also implemented the sort service. Also, I updated the user model and the e-mail to be sent to the user in this time period. The Search algorithm performs Full Text Search on the title and body of the post. Each word in the given query is searched separately in the relevant fields and a vector is formed. According to this resulting vector, each post gets a rank. Posts are sorted from highest rank to lowest.
I created realistic posts and comments in the application. I also reviewed pull requests in constant communication with my teammates. I merged what I thought was appropriate. Finally, I prepared the api endpoints document for the final milestone report.

### *Main contributions*

I am a member of our frontend team for the development of our application. As front-end team, we determined which functionalities we will provide for the Final Milestone. We decided to design and implement annotation related functioanlities for image and text annotation, email verification for sign up process, search functionality for posts and users,password confirmation for regular sign up process, chatbot functioanlity. We assigned these functionalities into every member. I was assgined to email verification for sign up process, search functionality for posts and users,password confirmation for regular sign up process. I was also assigned to finding bugs of the our application,medical experience sharing application,named. After detecting possible bugs, I have resolved them. We met regularly to talk about the progress of tasks assigned to each member and we gave feedbacks for possible improvements. Firstly, I reviewed some popular websites to get idea about the user interface of the email verification related pages. After some research, I designed email verificaiton page as two different page: e-mail validation code screen and success page containing a button for directing login page. I have provided backend connection for email verification page using API for the forgot password feature since backend team has not provided a backend connection for this functionality . Secondly, I have designed and implemented password  confirmation for regular user sign up process for our web application.I also provide backend connection for it. As a next task, I review some populer websites and libraries to design and implement search functionality for users and posts .After that research period, I have designed and implemented search functionality. I also have implemented backend connection using API’s provided by our backend team. I have found three bugs during this milestone. These are “Compilation and Deployment of Web Application”, “Search Results Container Remove Search Bar” and “Static Sign Up Verification Code”. I resolved these bugs. For all these features I implemented, I wrote units test covering many cases. I have contributed to the development of the front-end and the main decisions about the project. I reviewed so many pull requests and made some comments about possible improvements and bugs. Before merging pull requests, I tested functionalities that are provided by that pull request manually to prevent possible bugs and conflicts with our requirements. 
	
In addition to code related tasks, I had different management related task for our team progress. I have prepared realistic scenarios for final presentation with Melih Aktaş. I have documented user ınterface and user experience for Milestone 3 Report providing related links for the implementations. I have prepared realistic and well-designed posts and comments,totals 25, for Milestone 3. Thanks to these posts, we can provide our customers real experience of the our application. In other words, we should simulate our system by using different users to provide a insight for our application.  Finally, I attended both general and frontend team meetings to collaborate with other team members.
