## Executive Summary

### *Description*
HEKA is a medical experience sharing platform where users share their ideas and experiences related to medical issues in a restricted social environment. 
It serves as native web and Android application.
### *Overall Status*
Team members went over the requirements and design diagrams of the application and planned the implementation phase. The team were divided into three groups forming backend, frontend, and mobile teams. The implementation phase was initiated just after the formation of teams. The main objective was to get a fully-deployed application with registration, login, and logout functionalities up until Milestone 1. In addition, frontend and mobile team asked backend team to integrate Swagger IO to the application to get self-generated API documentation, which is believed to help not only frontend and mobile team members pursue their own development easily but also customers to visualize and test the existing APIs during the development phase. Due to some inconsistencies in the deployment pipeline of frontend application, the objective was partially fulfilled. After the demo, team members planned to to fix the deployment pipeline of frontend application as soon as possible and integrate it with the fully-deployed backend application.

### *API URL(s)*
- /api/user/register
- /api/user/login
- /api/user/logout
- /swagger/

### *Current Functionality of HEKA*
- Users could register, login to the application, and logout from the application via native Android application.

## Evaluation of Deliverables






---------


## Evaluation of Tools and Processes
- AWS ECR: We used this to store docker images of the backend and the database. It is easy to use.
- AWS EC2: It is one of the most popular cloud platforms. EC2 machines are easy to create and manage. Since it is very popular, it is easy to find sources about them.
- Github Actions: We used it to create a CI/CD pipeline for the backend. Since it is integrated to the github, CI/CD pipeline status looks great when a contributer commits to the predefined branches. 
- PostgreSQL: It is popular and easy to use. There are a lot of sources about its integration with Github.
- Postman
- ProjectLibre
- Android Studio
- Class Diagram çizdiğimiz tool

## Summary of Work

* İbrahim Melih Aktaş

work  | desc
------------- | -------------
Work done | I created the boilerplate of the backend with the Django. I created Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml for the Django backend and the postgreSQL database. I created an AWS account and create an appropriate user with the necessary permissions. I created an EC2 machine. I created a CI/CD  pipeline with the Github Actions which detects the commits on the heka-backend branch and builds the Docker image. Then that pipeline pushes that Docker image to a public repository on the AWS ECR and then it connects to the EC2 machine on the AWS by using SSH connection. Then it pulls the image from the AWS ECR and runs a container on that EC2 instance. I increased the token expiration time in order to make testing easier. I reviewed the pull requests created by the other team members from the backend.

Work Done | Since i have some experience in React before, I have created the code base for the frontend team (Arranging folder and file formats, Implementing router mechanism, Installing libraries). Then i have implemented the navigation bar by using best practises of React and css. I also responsible for the home page. In the home page we need to render the posts written by the users. In order to do that i first created Post component that renders a single post. Then i have implemented PostBox component that renders multiple post with the data i have created. Then i implemented HomePage component with the PostBox component and implemented unit test cases for these components. I also create a backend connection base by using appropriate React libraries and implement postLogin and postRegister functions that enable easily making http request to the relevant rest apis. I also added css animations to the navigation bar and home page and helped to improve ui of the login and sign up pages. Lastly, I implemented a structure for lifting state up that allow us to store global states in React after i implement it I hide private components from unauthorized users.
