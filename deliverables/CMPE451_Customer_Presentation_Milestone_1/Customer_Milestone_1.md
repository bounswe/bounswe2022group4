### **Main contributions**

I made some info updateson my personal wiki page. I also revisioned the sidebar accordin to current semesters needs. And I created a new communication channel on Discord according group needs. I joined the all meetings and contributed to how should things happen and why. I reviewed the requerments and also added change suggestion as a issue. I researched the android architecture and made practice about both kotlin and android apps as we decided to use kotlin at beginning. Before I used Flutter to develop some mobile apps but android is complete different and I spent too many time to learn somethings about it. Finally I implemented the profile page of the mobile.As because profile page has no functionality yet there is no test for it.
