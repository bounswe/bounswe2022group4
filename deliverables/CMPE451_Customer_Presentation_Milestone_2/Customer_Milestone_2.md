## Executive Summary

### **Summary of the Project Status:**

Team members went over again the requirements and some of them have changed due to needs.
The team were implemented features after getting the related apis from the backend team. The aimed features which are planned to implemented in Milestone II has done except notification. The annotations has implemented on client side for now. Due to actuality of concept for us, this will be implemented fully in final project. Also search is not has fancy features as we planned before, it is OK but not enough for our standarts. Search will be better. There is a list of planned functionalities:

* POST
* COMMENT 
* ANNOTATION `(Partially done)`
* FORGET/RESET PASSWORD
* SEARCH 
* PROFILE/EDIT PROFILE
* CATEGORY 
* NOTIFICATION `(Not implemented)`
* CHAT

The main objective of Milestone 2 was implementing most of the features which a general user will use and enhancing the UI experience of the user for both web and mobile.  In addition to planned features, authentication system has revisioned and sidebar of the we has revisioned regarding to new features. Another new concept for us is uploading the images, for now our system send images directly instead of url of the image which is restrick us on caching the images. There is still an active work on this subject, there could be further updates. The deployed server is failing rarely, this is not a big issue for now, but it will be resolved soon by our team.

</br>

### **Changes the team has made or planned since Milestone 1 to improve development process, and how those changes will impact the process:**


* The teams decided to move faster than the previous milestone. To achive that we run decide operations locally. Little clans decided feature behaviours, which are not too important, in light of the requirements.
* The team decided to match UIs of both mobile and front side for consistency. It has achived partially, the themes are not completely same but they have common colors and patterns in itselves. 
* The front-end deployment has been automized to observe changes without using local deployment techniques.


</br>

### **The Improvements Planned for the Remainder of the Project:**


The further features which will be implemented in final milestone is like below:
* Enhancing search
* Enhancing post view for better UX
* Integration of categories semanticaly
* Chatbot to improve UX
* Saving and serving annotations on server side
* Health professional integration on application
* Better image managing on client side
* Completing theme gap between mobile and web
* Adding notifications for user interactions
* Profile page enhancement to see user activities

### Annotations

One of the key features of the web application is the annotation structure, which allows authorized users to annotate images using a drag and drop interface. This feature was implemented using the react-annotation library, and provides users with an intuitive and user-friendly way to add labels or tags to images.

The annotation structure is available in the web application, and can be accessed by authorized users. To use the annotation structure, users simply need to select an image and then use the drag and drop interface to add labels or tags to the image.The annotation structure is not currently available in the mobile application, but it is planned to be implemented in a future update. Additionally, the annotation structure is not currently integrated with the backend, but this is also planned for future development.

Overall, the implementation of the annotation structure using the react-annotation library has greatly improved the functionality and usability of the web application. It allows users to add additional information and context to images, and makes it easier for users to find and access specific images within the application.

### **Main contributions**
I am a member of our frontend team for the development of our application. As front-end team, we determined which functionalities we will provide for Milestone 2. We decided to design and implement post related functioanlities, forget password functionalitiy, search functionality, category sidebar, edit profile and chat functioanlity. We assigned these functionalities into every member. I was assgined to forget password, search and category section in homepage. We met regularly to talk about the progress of tasks assigned to each member and we gave feedbacks for possible improvements. Firstly, I reviewed some popular websites to get idea about the user interface of the fprget password related pages. After some research,  I designed forget password page as a three different page: e-mail validation screen, new password screen and success page containing a button for directing login page. I provided backend connection for all forget password related pages. Secondly, I designed and implemented category feature for our web application. Since backend team have not provided required APIs yet, I could not provide backend connection for that function. As a next task, I review some populer websites and libraries to design and implement semantic search functionality.After that research period, I have designed and implemented search functionality. For all these features I implemented, I wrote units test covering many cases. I have contributed to the development of the front-end and the main decisions about the project. I reviewed so many pull requests and made some comments about possible improvements and bugs. Before merging pull requests, I tested functionalities that are provided by that pull request manually to prevent possible bugs and conflicts with our requirements. I also found different bugs and resolved them. I documented progress of requirements for Milestone 2 Report. I also documented user interface and experience of our web and mobil applications providing related links for the implementations.

### *Main contributions*

For the milestone 2, i have implemented most of the functionalities in the frontend. I first implemented doctor sign up page by adding special fields such as uploading diploma, choosing branch etc. Then according the first customer presentation feedbacks i hide the private information of the users from the unauthorized users. Since our backend structure has change i have changed whole backend structure in frontend as well (Authentication Token usage). Then i have started to implement crucial functionalities. I have implemented create post, delete post, edit post, upvote post, downvote post functionalities and connect them to backend. Also, i have implemented create comment, delete comment, upvote-downvote comment functionalities and connect them to backend. In all of these backend connections there is a small delay, in order to provide better user experience i have implemented loading sliders for the delays.

One of my main contributions to the project was the implementation of an image annotation structure using React libraries. This involved researching and selecting appropriate React libraries for the task, and then using those libraries to create a structure for adding annotations to images within the web application. The image annotation structure I implemented allows users to add labels or tags to images by drag and drop, which can provide additional information about the content of the images.

I also created a structure that allows rendering images by converting base64 text to images on frontend and storing them in our database by converting image to base64 text for the efficiency. My other contribution was development of unit test cases for the components that I created. This involved writing test cases that would verify the functionality and correctness of the components, and ensure that they were working properly.

I worked on improvement of the user interface for the comment and post components of the web application. This involved working on the layout, design, and overall appearance of these components, with the goal of making them more user-friendly and intuitive. In addition to improving the UI of these components, I also played a role in reviewing pull requests and issues within the frontend team. This involved carefully examining the code and functionalities of new features and changes, and providing feedback and suggestions for improvements. Another key contribution I made was providing support to other team members who encountered problems or challenges during the development process. This involved offering guidance and advice on technical issues, as well as helping to troubleshoot and resolve any problems that arose. In addition to these responsibilities, I also conducted research on various React libraries and technologies, such as Material UI Modals, React api-sauce, and react-annotation. This research helped to inform the development of new features and functionalities for the web application. I also played a role in preparing for and presenting the web application at Customer Meeting 2, which involved working on the presentation materials and delivering a detailed overview of the features and capabilities of the web application. Finally, I worked on solving bugs and issues in the implementation of the frontend of the web application, and attended both General and Frontend Team Meetings to stay up-to-date on the latest developments and progress on the project. Overall, my contributions to the project were focused on improving the functionality and user experience of the web application.
