### **Responsibilities**
Update and Get endpoints for the Profile Page. List-post endpoint which returns a list for all the posts. Deployment of the frontend. Creating a CI/CD pipeline with Github Actions for the frontend. Maintain the test server.


### **Main contributions**
* I created Get and Put endpoints for the Profile Page. Get returns the necessary user information. Put endpoint updates the fields changed by the user. I created tests for them.
* I created an endpoint for the list all posts. 
* I prepared a CI/CD pipeline for the front end using Github Actions(#350). It builds docker image and it pushes it to the AWS ECR. Then it connects to our EC2 machine, pulls new image and runs it on the [EC2 machine](http://3.75.133.58:3000). 
* I was responsible for the maintaining test server. I worked on the problems that occurs on the test server. I sent the logs of the errors to my team. I tried to fix them.
